    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=When creating a custom exception in Python, you need to subclass the Exception class to inherit its functionality and behavior. The Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python, and it provides various methods and attributes that are necessary for custom exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception has access to all the features of an exception, such as the ability to be raised, caught, and handled. Additionally, the Exception class provides methods like __init__, __str__, and __repr__ that you can override to customize the behavior of your custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "By subclassing the Exception class, you also ensure that your custom exception is compatible with other exception-handling code that expects to catch Exception objects or its subclasses. This means that your custom exception can be handled by the same code that handles built-in exceptions, making it easier to write robust and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the Exception class as the base class for your custom exception ensures that it inherits all the necessary functionality and behavior of an exception and allows it to be handled correctly by other exception-handling code.\n",

    "In this example, we attempt to divide the number 1 by zero, which is not possible in arithmetic. This raises a ZeroDivisionError with the message \"division by zero\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how the FloatingPointError and ZeroDivisionError exceptions are raised when there is an error during an arithmetic operation, and how they can be caught and handled using a try-except block.\n",

    "Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",

    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how the KeyError and IndexError exceptions are raised when a lookup operation fails, and how they can be caught and handled using a try-except block. The LookupError class is used as a base class for these exceptions because they both represent cases where a lookup operation failed due to the absence of a key or index.\n",
